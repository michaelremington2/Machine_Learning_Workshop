# Machine_Learning_Workshop
This is a workshop I developed to learn the basic concepts of machine learning and apply them to build and evaluate a random forest model. The data for this workshop is australian rain forcast data. Our goal is to become meteriologists for the day and see if we can predict if it will rain tomorrow!
